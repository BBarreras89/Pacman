# Pacman
The Classic Pacman Game

I will code the classic game everybody knows and loves PACMAN.
This will work on your browser by using HTML and CSS for the styling, make the website appealing.
For this we intregate the following features.
          - a map
          -the game-loop (winning condition, losing condition
          -a pacman symbol that moves
          - the ghosts ( they have to states: one where they touch you and you lose the game and one where you can eat them and earn extra point)
          - 2 different dots ( one normal for earning points, one for making ghost eatable and earning extra points)
          
 If possible we will use sounds for our game.
